# Insurance Complaints Analysis

![dashboard](https://github.com/preetparmar/Data-Visualization/blob/main/Insurance%20Complaints%20Analysis%20using%20Power%20BI/Resources/Screenshots/Dashboard.png)

- This dashboard analyses Insurance Complaints data.
- The main focus for this project is enhancing the user interaction experience.
- I have used various advanced techniques like:
  - Syncing Slicers across different pages
  - Use of Buttons for navigation purpose
  - Created a seperate view for filters
  - Added various elements to highligh the current page
  - Used Dynamic Measures for titles, showing selected date ranges and regions
  - Use of other visuals as tooltip
  - Custom formating using icons in table
  - Use of paramets for the added interactivity
  - Designed custom theme for a uniform look across the entire dashboard

**_Please Note:_**

- _This dashboard design is inspired by an entry from Sam McKay. You can find the link to his blog [here](https://forum.enterprisedna.co/t/power-bi-challenge-6-insurance-complaints-entry-from-sam-m/10402)._
- _I have tweaked the design, changed some visuals and UI elements._
